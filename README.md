# wle-project
This repo contains the R markdown file and the compiled HTML file for the final project of the JHU practical machine learning course in the Coursera Data Sciences specialization.

The URL for the gh-pages site for this repo is https://jeffspoelstra.github.io/wle-project/.

The project_files folder contains the image files for the HTML document.
The project_cache folder contains the knitr cache files for the model training output. Using the cache files will save considerable time should the Rmd file need to be re-knit.
